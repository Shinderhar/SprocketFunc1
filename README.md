# SprocketFunc1
A simple executable that sets all your sprocket blueprint's thicknesses as 1mm, and grid size as 0 to make the editing experience as close to 0.127 as possible
Even if there isn't a chance that the program can corrupt the blueprint, PLEASE make a backup of your creation before applying this to it. I don't want to be responsible for art being destroyed

# How to use:
If you do not have a python IDE or wish to not use it:
1. Download the zip file (code -> download zip) with the project
2. Unpack the zip file into the folder of choice
3. Navigate to the SprocketFunc folder

5. Inside the console, enter or insert the path to your .blueprint file with the name of the file and the extension. (example: C:\Users\user\Documents\My Games\Sprocket\Factions\Default\Blueprints\Vehicles\Centurion.blueprint)
6. Press Enter
7. Enjoy

If you have a python IDE (or do not trust the executable):
